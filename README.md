# Handle-Gesture-Recognition
Handle is a motion glove controller designed with the intentions of controlling different pieces of hardware. Before we start controlling anything hand movements need to be detected with a very high degree of accuracy and that's exactly why this repository exists.
This project involves the use of an accelerometer and an arduino-uno to recognize hand movements. The code is provided along with a software block diagram, demo video, and an operation report detailing the gloves functionality. ENJOY!

Below is a video of the glove in action

Future versions of this glove will use this algorithm to control the position of a mouse cursor on a windows system.
